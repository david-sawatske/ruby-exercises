### Substrings and Subwords
#
# Write a method, `substrings`, that will take a `String` and return an
# array containing each of its substrings. Don't repeat substrings.
# Example output: `substrings("cat") => ["c", "ca", "cat", "a", "at",
# "t"]`.
#
# Your `substrings` method returns many strings that are not true English
# words. Let's write a new method, `subwords`, which will call
# `substrings`, filtering it to return only valid words. To do this,
# `subwords` will accept both a string and a dictionary (an array of
# words).
